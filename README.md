# CTF_Round-1
## COMMIT THE ðŸš© Round-1 commences

Hello, hackers! This is the first round. 
* The flag is hidden somewhere in this repository. Since this is the first Round, I can give you a hint.
* The hint is: **the name of the event** can guide you to the place where the flag is.
* You can either follow the hint or choose to ignore it and explore this github repo thoroughly.
* If you know your git you can cruise through this round easily.
* When you find the flag, the format will be **commit{......}**, the content inside the flag will confirm if you found a dummy flag or a real one

So put on your hacker mask and try to find the flag. After finding the flag, first go to the submission portal to submit the flag. Then go to this url for the next round:- https://*{content inside the curly brackets of commit flag}*.deta.dev

This is just the start! Happy Hacking!
