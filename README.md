# CTF_Round-1
## COMMIT THE ðŸš© Round-1 commences

Hello, hackers! This is the first round. 
* The flag is hidden somewhere in this repository. Since this is the first Round, I can give you a hint.
* The Hint is : **the name of the event** can guide you to the place where the flag is.
* You can either follow the hint or choose to ignore it and explore this github repo thoroughly.
* If you know your git you can cruise through this round easily.
* When you find the flag, the format will be **commit{......}**, the content inside the flag will confirm if you found a dummy flag or the real one

So put on your hacker mask and try to find the flag. After finding the flag, you will be able to advance to the next CTF round.
This is just the start! Happy Hacking!
